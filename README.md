# Fully Fused Differentiable Bilateral Grid

Fused bilateral grid inspired by [fused-ssim](https://github.com/rahul-goel/fused-ssim) and its forks.

Bilateral grid introduced in the paper *Bilateral Guided Radiance Field Processing* (https://bilarfpro.github.io/) has shown to improve visual quality of radiance fields significantly, especially in the presense of exposure changes during capture. But it comes with performance bottleneck.

This implementation is intended to be compatible with [Nerfstudio's fork of original bilateral grid](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/blob/5003d0e2711d9231908d81bc0e0b7823f96889b0/nerfstudio/model_components/lib_bilagrid.py). Currently, it implements the class `BilateralGrid` and accelerates functions `slice` and `total_variation_loss`, which are used in training in Nerfstudio's `splatfacto` method. More features may be added in the future, and contributions are welcome.

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations (dev_fast branch)

This branch includes significant performance optimizations for non-uniform sampling:

### Forward Pass Optimizations
- **Spatial Locality Caching**: Uses shared memory to cache bilagrid data within thread blocks
- **Memory Coalescing**: Improved memory access patterns for better bandwidth utilization
- **Expected Speedup**: 15-25% improvement over the original implementation

### Backward Pass Optimizations  
- **Hierarchical Reduction**: Reduces atomicAdd contention by local accumulation
- **AtomicAdd Reduction**: Reduces atomic operations from 96 to ~12 per thread
- **Expected Speedup**: 40-60% improvement over the original implementation

### Usage
Use the optimized versions with:
```python
from fused_bilagrid import slice_fast, total_variation_loss

# Fast non-uniform sampling
out = slice_fast(bil_grids, xy, rgb, idx)
```

See `tests/benchmark_fast.py` for performance benchmarks and `OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed analysis.



## Quick Start

To install, use the following command (tested on Ubuntu 22.04, PyTorch 2.1.2+cu118):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harry7557558/fused-bilagrid.git
cd fused-bilagrid
pip install . --no-build-isolation
```

To use in Nerfstudio, instead of:

```py
from nerfstudio.model_components.lib_bilagrid import BilateralGrid, slice, total_variation_loss

bil_grids = BilateralGrid(num_train_data)

grid_y, grid_x = torch.meshgrid(
    torch.linspace(0, 1.0, H, device=self.device),
    torch.linspace(0, 1.0, W, device=self.device),
    indexing="ij",
)
xy = torch.stack([grid_x, grid_y], dim=-1).unsqueeze(0)

out = slice(bil_grids, xy, rgb, idx)

tv_loss = total_variation_loss(bil_grids.grids)
```

Do this:

```py
from fused_bilagrid import BilateralGrid, slice, total_variation_loss

bil_grids = BilateralGrid(num_train_data)

out = slice(bil_grids, None, rgb, idx)

tv_loss = total_variation_loss(bil_grids.grids)
```

If `xy` is not provided, the implementation assumes the above `xy`. You can optionally provide `xy`, and the function will work for irregular `xy` and is differentiable to all real inputs, but there may be performance drop compared to a default `xy` &ndash; still multiple times faster compared to PyTorch implementation, see benchmark below.


### Calibration (optional)

In current implementation, the performance can vary on different GPUs. To get optimal performance for your setup, after installation, pause other programs that may take high GPU/CPU usage and run:

```bash
python3 fused_bilagrid/calibration.py
```

The script will profile code across various image and grid resolutions and save results. When running backward for `slice` with default `xy`, it will determine the fastest hyperparameters to use based on saved results.


## Benchmark

Benchmark below is performed on my laptop with an RTX 4070. `slice` is performed with batch size `1`, common in Gaussian splatting training. See `tests/profile.py` for details.

### `slice` with default `xy`, [16, 16, 8] grid:

### `slice` with default `xy`, [8, 8, 4] grid:

![](tests/assets/Uniform_Sample_[8,_8,_4].png)

### `total_variation_loss`:

![](tests/assets/Total_Variation_Loss.png)

### `slice` with random `xy`, [16, 16, 8] grid:

![](tests/assets/Irregular_Sample_[16,_16,_8].png)

### Overall training:

When training `splatfacto` with bilateral grid on one dataset with around 800 1080x1440 images, `fused_bilagrid` reduces total training time by **3.5 times** compared to `nerfstudio.model_components.lib_bilagrid`.

I'm not an expert in GPU programming, so it's likely that the implementation is still far from optimal. You are welcome to suggest changes via issue/PR and create forks of the project.


## Consistency with PyTorch implementation

Bilateral grid sampling involves bilinear interpolation, which is C0 continuous and therefore involves undefined gradient. This happens with default `xy` for some image resolutions. This implementation detects such discontinuity and sets gradient to zero, while PyTorch appears to assign an arbitrary value. This difference does not practically affect radiance field training.

For image resolutions that don't fall on discontinuity, relative error with PyTorch implementation is typically well below `1e-5`, but may be noisy due to stochastic nature of `atomicAdd`.
